# mrugesh.test.hmrc
assignment of hmrc webpage demo

The folder structre is - hmrc > index.html, js css img
due to time constrain I have only focus to show my dev skills rather deeply going into mobile specific changes. 
I have not done one piece of small UI part which I am suspecting may be show/hide with js ( Tax number dialogue block )
